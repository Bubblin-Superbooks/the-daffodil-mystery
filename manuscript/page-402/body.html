"I have just read in the <em>Evening Press</em>, with the deepest sorrow and despair, the news that my dearly Beloved wife, Catherine Rider, has been foully murdered. How terrible to think that a few hours ago I was conversing with her assassin, as I believe Sam Stay to be, and had inadvertently given him information as to where Miss Rider was to be found!

When this reaches you I shall be beyond the power of human vengeance, for I have determined to end a life which has held so much sorrow</p></div> </div>
