I was working very late that night."</p><p>"In your own office?"</p><p>"No," replied the other readily, "I did most of my work in Mr. Lyne's officeâ€”at his request," he added. A bold statement to make to a man who knew that Lyne suspected him of robbing the firm. But Milburgh was nothing if not bold.</p><p>"Did he also give you the key of his desk?" asked the detective dryly.</p><p>"Yes, sir," beamed Mr. Milburgh, "of course he did! You see, Mr. Lyne trusted me absolutely."</p></div> </div>
