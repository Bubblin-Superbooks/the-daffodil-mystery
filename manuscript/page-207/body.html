You're perfectly sure, Cole, that that telegram did not reach Mr. Lyne?"</p><p>"Perfectly, sir," said Cole emphatically. "I took it in myself. After Mr. Lyne drove off I went to the door of the house to get a little fresh air, and I was standing on the top step when it came up. If you notice, sir, it's marked 'received at 9.20'â€”that means the time it was received at the District Post Office, and that's about two miles from our place. It couldn't possibly have got to the house before Mr. Lyne left, and I was scared to death that you clever gentlemen would have seen that."</p><p>"I was so clever that I didn't see it," admitted Tarling with a smile. "Thank you, Mr. Cole, that will do."</p></div> </div>
